# C64RobotGuitar
Commodore 64 Robot Guitar project
Using a combination of a Commodore 64 and Arduino, this project initially
uses G-Pascal (a version of Pascal for the Commodore 64 written by Nick Gammon
and Sue Gobbett of Gambit Games in 1983) for most of it's code, but also has
some machine code elements to help speed up some critical parts. I'm working
on a version that runs all the code on the Commodore 64 entirely in machine
code, and will update this project with this later code as this progresses.
